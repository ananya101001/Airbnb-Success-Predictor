## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains an academic project that develops a data-driven framework for predicting the success of Airbnb listings. The system leverages Airbnb listing data, U.S. Census data, and Walk Score data to predict nightly price, occupancy likelihood, and success drivers for short-term rental properties.

**Why This Matters:**
- Short-term rental investing is risky without proper analysis
- Market conditions vary significantly by location and property type
- Data-driven insights can help investors make informed decisions
- Success prediction combines multiple factors: price, demand, location, reviews

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Real estate investors face critical challenges when considering Airbnb investments:

1. **Pricing Uncertainty:** What nightly rate will maximize revenue without losing bookings?
2. **Demand Prediction:** Will the property attract enough guests to be profitable?
3. **Location Impact:** How do socioeconomic factors and walkability affect success?
4. **Competitive Analysis:** Which properties outperform competitors and why?
5. **Risk Reduction:** How can investors reduce investment risk through data analysis?

This project builds a **machine learning framework** to answer these questions.

## 📈 Data Sources

### 1. **Airbnb Listing Data** 
**Source:** [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) – listing data (price, amenities, reviews, etc.)
- **Records:** ~27,000 listings
- **Features:** Price, amenities, room type, capacity, reviews, host info, description
- **Target Variables:** Nightly price, occupancy rate, review scores

### 2. **U.S. Census Data**
**Source:** [U.S. Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/) – socioeconomic context
- **Features:** Income levels, employment rates, education, demographics
- **Purpose:** Understand neighborhood economic factors affecting rental demand
- **Integration:** Spatial join with listing locations

### 3. **Walk Score Data**
**Source:** [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/walk-score-data.php) – neighborhood walkability
- **Features:** Walkability scores (0-100), transit access, bike score
- **Purpose:** Assess neighborhood accessibility and lifestyle factors
- **Impact:** High walkability often correlates with higher nightly rates

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### **Part 1: Data Integration & Exploration**
- Merged Airbnb data with Census and Walk Score using reverse geocoding
- Performed spatial joins to match listings with census tracts
- Conducted EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations

### **Part 2: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)**

Applied K-Means & Fractal Clustering to segment ~27,000 listings.

**Clustering Objectives:**
- Identify natural groupings of similar properties
- Find high-performing clusters balancing profitability and satisfaction
- Create business-meaningful segments (e.g., "luxury," "budget," "tourist-focused")

**Golden Cluster Definition:**
Defined a Golden Cluster of properties balancing profitability and guest satisfaction.

Criteria for "Golden Cluster":
- Higher than median occupancy rate
- Higher than median nightly price
- Higher than median review scores
- Consistent performance metrics

**Outcome:** Created a binary target `is_golden_cluster` for supervised learning.

### **Part 3: Supervised Learning (Classification)**

Amalgamated Airbnb data with Census & Walk Score data using reverse geocoding and spatial joins.

**Model Development:**

Ran multiple models to predict `is_golden_cluster`:
- Random Forest → F1: 0.9798, AUC: 0.9952
- XGBoost → F1: 0.9738, AUC: 0.9992
- KNN → F1: 0.8855, AUC: 0.9741
- SVM → F1: 0.7585, AUC: 0.9645

**Models Evaluated:**
1. **Random Forest:** Tree-based ensemble, strong feature importance
2. **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting, best predictive power
3. **KNN:** Instance-based learning, captures local patterns
4. **SVM:** Support Vector Machine, handles non-linear boundaries

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- Grid search / Random search for optimal parameters
- Cross-validation (5-fold) for robust evaluation
- Class balancing (weighted loss) for imbalanced data

### **Key Insights**

Insight: Ensemble models benefited most from enriched datasets.

1. **Data Enrichment Matters:** Adding Census & Walk Score data improved model performance by 12-15%
2. **Ensemble Models Excel:** Random Forest and XGBoost outperform simple classifiers
3. **High Precision:** Models correctly identify successful properties 97%+ of the time
4. **Feature Importance:** Amenities, location metrics, and review scores are top predictors

### **Business Outcomes**

Identified hidden gem neighborhoods outside obvious tourist centers.

Built a Success Score (0–100) combining price, demand probability, and review scores.

Key Discoveries:
- Properties with high walkability (70+) earn 18% more on average
- Certain neighborhoods have 40%+ higher occupancy rates despite lower visibility
- Specific amenity combinations increase success likelihood by 25-35%
